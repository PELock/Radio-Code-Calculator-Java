# Radio Code Calculator Online & SDK for Java

**[Radio Code Calculator](https://www.pelock.com/products/radio-code-calculator)** is an online service along with [Web API & SDK](https://www.pelock.com/products/radio-code-calculator/sdk) for generating car radio unlock codes for popular vehicle brands.

Following a breakdown or a disconnection of the car battery, most of the vehicle radio & navigation units will ask for an unlocking code. It's standard anti-theft protection.

Our car Radio Code Calculator allows you to generate **100% valid** radio codes to unlock car radios & navigation without the need to use the expensive service of authorized dealers.

The service is available through a simple online interface and `Web API`, with multiple `SDK` development libraries for popular programming languages.

Thanks to our solution, you can create, for instance, mobile or web applications that allow for easy generation of radio codes.

## Supported car models and radios

Our service is being continuously developed and new algorithms are gradually added for new car models and their radios.

If a new algorithm is added, you will get automatic and free access to it as part of your current license.

Individual calculators are available on our site as a paid service for end customers. You can verify them and see lists of supported radios on the relevant subpages:

## Use of radio code calculator

Where and who can use the radio code generation service and make money from code generation?

### ![Android](https://www.pelock.com/img/en/icons/android-32.png) App developers 
The main audience for our software is clearly developers and programmers, either of mobile or desktop applications.

### ![Shoping cart](https://www.pelock.com/img/en/icons/cart-32.png) Online stores 
If you run an online e-commerce store, you can sell radio codes through it using our software solutions.

### ![Car](https://www.pelock.com/img/en/icons/car-32.png) Auto repair shops
We also encourage car repair shops whose customers often use car radio unlocking services.

### ![Person](https://www.pelock.com/img/en/icons/user-32.png) Private individuals
Private individuals will also profit from our solution by generating codes and selling them on car forums or auction sites such as eBay, Craigslist.

### No limits!

You can generate codes **without limitation** with your purchased one year license.

Set your own price for generating a single code and start earning by using **tried and tested** algorithms from a programming language you know.

If you are not a programmer - don't worry. Just use our [online calculator](https://www.pelock.com/products/radio-code-calculator/online).
